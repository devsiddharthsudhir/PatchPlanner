# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing.

## Quickstart
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-change`
3. Run locally:
   - `make dev` (starts backend + frontend)
   - `make test` (runs backend tests)
4. Open a PR with:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - Screenshots for UI changes

## Style
- Keep functions small and named by intent.
- Prefer explicit types and clear variable names over cleverness.
- Add a short rationale comment where the optimizer is doing something non-obvious.
